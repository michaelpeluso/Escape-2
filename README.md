## DESCRIPTION

Trapped in three separate escape rooms linked together, with time as their enemy, players must think quickly and solve puzzles to escape.

Each puzzle room has a separate puzzle, functioning differently than the last. No two puzzles will look the same! The game also includes a free mode that allows players to solve puzzles with no danger. However, completing a level in the free mode does not contribute to progression and players will still need to get through the normal difficulty.


Main Goal:

Escape the Rooms before time runs out.


Main Character: 

The Player themselves is the main character.



Player Count:

    Strictly singleplayer, however there is a cooperative element in that if players are watched by friends, they can offer advice and share in the players' stress. While not a multiplayer game, we hope to offer an entertaining time for everyone who plays and watches.


Game Modes:

    Normal Mode [Solving puzzles with the time ticking down]
    Free Mode [Allows players to solve with no time stress, but does not progress their save file]
    Room Selection [Allows players to replay levels]

## SCOPE

How long is the game? 

    The game's length is dependent on the player's ability to solve puzzles, 
    one level may take 5 minutes, another may take 15. The player's ability defines their pace.


How many levels are there? 

    There are 3 levels for the player to traverse, each changing based on the developer behind it.


What is the average playtime? 
    
    As stated prior, the average playtime should not exceed one hour, 
    depending on the player's ability to do effective problem solving.


What are the objectives? 
    
    The main goal and  objective is to escape the rooms

How many playable characters? 

    There is only one playable character, the player themselves.

Can you customize or upgrade them/what can you customize? 

    At this time, no customization options are planned as the only real upgrades 
    a player can gain is the knowledge of how to solve the puzzles.
